This is a rough draft of my personal website. I decided to open-source it while I'm working on it.


SQL
requires sql.php in the root and another in /admin/

$mysql_host	(address of the host)  
$mysql_database	(database name)  
$mysql_user	(username)  
$mysql_password	(password)

required tables for root sql are blog, blogcache, and resources.
